# 📈 S&P 500 Intraday News Sentiment Analysis (Mar–Apr 2025)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform **hourly sentiment analysis** of major S&P 500 stocks based on financial news headlines scraped from Finviz. It aims to identify how investor sentiment evolves in real-time across different sectors in response to macroeconomic and firm-specific events.

We analyze the period from **March 26 to April 15, 2025**, with special attention to companies like **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**, whose sentiment exhibited a sharp reversal aligned with key headlines and analyst actions.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Track **hourly sentiment trends** across top S&P 500 constituents
- Group sentiment patterns by **sector** (Technology, Energy, Healthcare, etc.)
- Identify **spikes or reversals** linked to macroeconomic news (e.g., U.S. tariff policy)
- Visualize sentiment behavior through **bar charts and line plots**

## 📌 Example Insight – Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Between **April 13 and 14**, AAPL exhibited consistently **negative sentiment**, likely influenced by concerns over trade tensions and potential supply chain disruptions. On **April 15**, sentiment surged to highly positive levels following major **analyst upgrades** and coverage like:

> *“Apple stock pops 6% as investors bet tariffs ease.”*

This illustrates how investor sentiment can shift rapidly in response to headline framing and analyst narratives — a phenomenon that can be quantified and visualized using NLP.
